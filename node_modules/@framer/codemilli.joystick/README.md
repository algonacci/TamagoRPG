Virtual joystick for the mobile games.

You can use `JoyStickWrapper` component to wrap your device view. (The order of `JoyStickWrapper` component should be first in order to get touch events)

The x, y datas are exported from `JoyStickWrapper` component and you can bind that data to your character to move like below.

```typescript
import { Override } from "framer"
import { JoyStickData } from "./JoyStickWrapper"

export const onDrag: Override = () => {
    return {
        left: JoyStickData.x,
        top: JoyStickData.y,
    }
}
```
